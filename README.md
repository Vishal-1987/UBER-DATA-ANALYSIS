## INTRODUCTION:
#### As a leading ride-hailing service, Uber handles thousands of ride requests daily. However, a significant number of these requests remain unfulfilled due to cancellations or lack of available drivers, especially during peak hours and at specific locations like the City and Airport. This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride request data to uncover patterns in trip demand, cancellation trends, and driver availability. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help Uber improve ride fulfillment, enhance customer satisfaction, and support better operational decision-making.

## AIM:
#### To improve Uber’s ride fulfillment rate by analyzing request patterns, identifying causes of trip cancellations and unavailability, and optimizing driver distribution based on demand trends. The goal is to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce failed requests, and maximize operational efficiency during peak and non-peak hours.

## CONCLUSION:
#### The analysis of Uber ride request data revealed clear demand patterns, peak traffic hours, and key reasons behind unfulfilled trips. Most cancellations and "No Cars Available" issues occur during peak hours in the City, highlighting the need for better driver allocation. By leveraging these insights, Uber can optimize resource distribution, reduce service failures, and improve overall customer satisfaction — leading to better operational efficiency and business growth.¶
